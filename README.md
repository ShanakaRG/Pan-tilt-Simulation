# Pan-tilt-Simulation

Depending on the payload type and weight (antenna, camera, radar, etc) the user can select any combination of the above Pan Tilt Units for a true plug-n-Play operation. Regardless of the motorized unit used. Here we simulate the movement of antenna unit mounted to a pan-tilt unit. Desired pattern it to rotate antenna tip in an elliptical path and 2D and 3D simulation files are included.
